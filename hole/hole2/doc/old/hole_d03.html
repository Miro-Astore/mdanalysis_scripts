<a name=control><h2>3.0 Control of <small>HOLE</small></h2></a>

When <small>HOLE</small> is run the variables which the user can/must specify are read from
the FORTRAN input stream number 5 (defaults to the keyboard).  The text output
is to stream 6 (normally the screen).  The i/o streams should be redirected in the
manner normal for the operating system used.   For unix machines this is
achieved by typing the command: <p>
<a name=reass>
<b><tt>(nohup nice) hole < control_file.inp > log_file (&) </tt></b><p>

where hole refers to the executable, your $PATH variable should have been
modified so as point to this 
(see <a href="hole_d02.html#settingup">setup</a> section>). 
The <b><tt> > </tt></b> and <b><tt> < </tt></b> symbols reassign
the standard input and output steams to the files specified. 
<b><tt>control_file.inp</tt></b>  is a file
containing input information in the format described below and 
<b><tt>log_file.out</tt></b> is a file which will be created
containing text output describing how the run is progressing.  
(The nice and & put the program into the background
with lowered priority).  
The input is keyworded by the cards described below.
In general input is case-insensitive, except for
filenames - whose case is not changed on reading.  
Comments must be preceded by a ! and are not read.  
Comments can be placed at the end of any line
(they will be striped off before the line is
interpreted). 
The user is told of any non-blank line read and not recognized. <p>

<a name=card_must><h3>3.1 CARDS which MUST be specified:</h3></a>

<dl>
      <dt><tt><b><big><a name=COORD>COORD filename</a></big></b></tt>
       <dd> This specifies the name of co-ordinate file to be used. This must be in
       Brookhaven protein databank format or something closely approximating
       this.  Both ATOM and HETATM records are read.  Note that if water
       molecules or ions are present in the channel these can be ignored
       on read by the use of an <a href="#IGNORE">IGNORE</a> card.

        <p>
	A new feature (in release 2.1) was the option
	to include a wild card (*) in the filename. <i>e.g.,</i> <tt>coord ab*.pdb</tt>
        will apply hole to all files in the directory whose name starts with <tt>ab</tt> and
        ends with <tt>.pdb</tt>.  This intended to aid the analysis of
	multiple copies of the same molecule - produced during molecular dynamics
	or other method.
	The hole procedure will
        be applied to each file in turn with the same setup conditions (initial
	point, sampling distance etc.).  Graphics files will contain
	a combination of the individual runs, one after another.
	Note that the pdb files are read independently so that they need
	not have an identical number of atoms or atom order etc. (though
	they should be sufficiently similar for a <small>HOLE</small> run from identical
	starting conditions to be useful). 
	It may be useful to cut down the information
	written out to the text output by using a <a href=#SHORTO>SHORTO</a> 
	card (perhaps with level 2) if multiple files are used.
	Note that an alternative way to load in multiple files is
	a direct read from a CHARMm binary dynamics coordinate file - using
	a <a href=#CHARMD>CHARMD</a> card.
<p>
      <dt><tt><b><big><a name=RADIUS>RADIUS filename</a></big></b></tt>
       <dd>This specifies the name for the file specifying van der Waals radii for
       each atom.  A number of files with different values are supplied with
       <small>HOLE</small>, <a href=hole_d05.html>see section 5.0</a>.  Note
       	that HOLE unlike many programs now knows what a ~ means in unix
       	<i>e.g.,</i>
       	the to one can specify a radius file in user mary's directory:
	<pre>radius ~mary/hole2/rad/simple.rad</pre>

<dt><a name=card_may><h3>3.2 CARDS which may be specified</h3></a>

<dt><h4>The most useful cards:</h4>

       <dt><tt><b><big><a name=CPOINT>CPOINT x y z </a></big></b></tt> 
	             <i>(where x y and z are real numbers - separated by spaces)</i>
       <dd>This specifies a point which lies within the channel, for simple channels
       such as gramicidin results do not show great sensitivity to the exact point
       taken.  An easy way to produce an initial point is to use molecular
       graphics to find two atoms which lie either side of the pore and to
       average their co-ordinates. Or if the channel structure contains water molecules or
       counter ions then take the coordinates of one of these (and use an
       <a href="#IGNORE">IGNORE</a> card to ignore in the pore radius calculation).
<p>
       If this card is not specified then HOLE now (from 2.2) attempts to make a guess
       where the channel will be. The procedure assumes the channel is reasonably
       symmetric. The initial guess on cpoint will be the centroid of all
       alpha carbon atoms (name 'CA' in pdb file). This is then refined by a crude
       grid search up to 5 angstroms from the original position. This procedure
       works most of the time but is clearly far from infallible - results should
       be careful checked (with molecular graphics) if it is used.
<p>
       <dt><tt><b><big><a name=CVECT>CVECT x y z </a></big></b></tt> 
	             <i>(where x y and z are real numbers - separated by spaces)</i>
       <dd>This specifies a vector which lies in the direction of the channel/pore.

<p>
       If this card is not specified then HOLE now attempts to make a guess
       where the channel will be. The procedure assumes the channel is reasonably
       symmetric. The guess will be either along the X axis (1 0 0), Y axis (0 1 0)
       or Z axis (0 0 1). If the structure is not aligned on one of these axis the
       results will clearly be approximate. Once again if a guess is used then results
       should be carefully checked.

<p>
      <dt><tt><b><big><a name=SPHPDB>SPHPDB filename</a></big></b></tt>
       <dd>This card specifies the filename for output of the sphere centre
       information in pdb form. I normally use the identifier <tt>.sph</tt> for such files. 
        The co-ordinates are set to the sphere centres 
	and the occupancies are the sphere radii. All centres are assigned the 
        atom name QSS and residue
        name SPH and the residue number is set to the storage number of the
        centre. 
	The file can be imported into molecular graphics programs
	but are likely to be bonded together in a awful manner -
        as the points are very close to one another. In vmd sph
        objects are best displayed as "Points". Displaying .sph objects rather
	than rendered or dot surfaces can be useful to analyze the distance
	of particular atoms from the sphere-centre line.
        <p>

	Most usefully .sph files can be used to produce molecular graphical output
	from a hole run. This is achieved by using the 
        <a href="hole_d04.html#sph_process"><tt><b>sph_process</b></tt></a> 
	program to read the .sph file.
        (Previously <small>HOLE</small> could directly produce
        surface information but this is being phased out.)

<p>
      <dt><tt><b><big><a name=ENDRAD>ENDRAD real number</a></big></b></tt>
       <dd>
       This card can be used to specify the radius above which the program
       regards a result as an indicating that the end of the pore has been reached. 
       The default value is 15.0 angstroms. This may need to be increased for
       large channels or reduced for small.


<p>
      <dt><tt><b><big><a name=CONN>CONN</a></big></b></tt>
	             <i>or options can be set by: </i> <tt><b><big>CONN R<sub>probe</sub></big></b></tt>
	             <i>or</i> <tt><b><big>CONN R<sub>probe</sub>  D<sub>conn</sub></big></b></tt>
       <dd>
       This turns on the Connolly option. 
       This option was introduced in release 2.2 of hole.
       For each plane orthogonal to the channel vector cvect
       the normal hole process is performed in which the radius of
       a single probe sphere 
       is maximized on ther plane. The Connolly procedure then extends
       this to find the additional space accessible on the plane 
       for a probe of radius <tt><b>R<sub>probe</sub></b></tt> starting from 
       the normal hole final position. The surface produced by the HOLE Connolly
       should be essentially the same as locally accessible part of the MSMS or the surf
       procedure in vmd. The advantage of HOLE is that the external parts
       of the surface are cut away and that a measure is made of the accessible
       area for each plane.

       <p>
       <i>Brief description of the algorithm:</i>
       The Connolly procedure in HOLE starts from the spherical
       probe position. The procedure then constructs a 2D grid in the plane 
       with a spacing of <tt><b>D<sub>conn</sub></b></tt>. The procedure then proceeds to find 
       points on the grid that are adajacent to accepted points that can be 
       accomodate spheres of radius <tt><b>R<sub>probe</sub></b></tt> or above.
       The points are then added to accepted list. When no more points are added to
       the grid the edge of the accepted area is then adjusted so that the radius
       exactly matches <tt><b>R<sub>probe</sub></b></tt>.
       </p>

       <p> 
       It should be noted that the Connolly procedure takes longer than normal HOLE and
       it also results in many more sphere centres in the <a href="#SPHPDB">SPHPDB</a> file. 
       The default value for <tt><b>R<sub>probe</sub></b></tt> is 1.15 &Aring; - this
       is the radius necessary to accomodate a water molecule with the "simple.rad" set
       of van der Waals radii. The default value for  <tt><b>D<sub>conn</sub></b></tt> =
       0.7*<tt><b>R<sub>probe</sub></b></tt>. The only way to get molecular graphics
       output from the CONN procedure is via <a href="#SPHPDB">SPHPDB</a> output.
       </p>
       <p>
	<i>*** Should add a longer description of algorithm and results that can be
	   obtained with CONN ***</i>
	</p>

      <dt><tt><b><big><a name=IGNORE>IGNORE list_of_3_character_residue_types</a></big></b></tt>
       <dd>
	For fairly obvious reasons, in general it is a good idea to not 
	consider ions or water molecules within an ion channel during a <small>HOLE</small>
	run.  In the bad old days the only way to this was to edit out these
	records from the input file (specified by a <a href=#COORD>COORD</a> 
	card). Now this can be achieved by specifying an IGNORE card followed
	by a list of residue types (which are three character strings
	<i>e.g.,</i> alanine = <tt>ALA</tt>). Any atom whose residue
	name matches part of the list will be not be read in. Note that
	wildcards are not allowed in the match (if this is a pressing 
	problem tell me as this could be changed). <p>
	To ignore all waters a line like: <p>
	<tt><b>ignore hoh tip wat</b></tt><p>
	should appear in the control input file.   


<p>
<dt><h4>Other cards:</h4>


      <dt><tt><b><big><a name=SHORTO>SHORTO (optional integer)</a></big></b></tt>
       <dd>
	Normally during a <small>HOLE</small> run information as to the progress of the run is 
	continuously written to the output stream (which is normally 
	<a href=#reass>reassigned</a> to a file).
	It is informative to look at this information if one is doing an initial
	run as it can reveal such things as whether a sufficiently large number of
	Monte Carlo steps/step size has been specified.  But if one is performing many
	runs (e.g., repeated runs on a molecular dynamics trajectory) this information just 
	takes up space.  
	By specifying a SHORTO card the amount of information written out
	can be reduced -  the optional integer controlling how much or little is
	written: <p>
	<dl>
 		<dt><i>SHORTO 0</i>
		<dd> Full text output (equivalent of not specifying card!)
		<dt><i>SHORTO 1</i>
		<dd>All text output given except "run in progress" (<i>i.e.,</i>
		detailed contemporary description of what <small>HOLE</small> is doing).
		<dt><i>SHORTO 2</i>
		<dd>Ditto plus no graph type output - only leaving
		minimum radius and conductance calculations.
		<dt><i>SHORTO 3</i>
		<dd>All text output other than input card mirroring
		and error messages turned off.
	</dl>

	<p></p>


      <dt><tt><b><big><a name=SAMPLE>SAMPLE real_number</a></big></b></tt>
       <dd>
       Specifies the distance between the planes used in the HOLE procedure.  The default value is
       0.25 &Aring;, this should be reasonable for most purposes. However, if 
       you wish to visualize a very tight constriction then specify a smaller value.


	<p></p>
      	<dt><tt><b><big><a name=MCDISP>MCDISP real_number</a></big></b></tt>
       	<dd>
       Specifies the maximum step length to be taken in the Monte Carlo Simulated annealing
       The
       default value 0.1 &Aring;. For better sampling you can set this number higher:
       a good starting point is 1/10th of the minimum radius of the channel.

	<p></p>
      	<dt><tt><b><big><a name=MCKT>MCKT real_number</a></big></b></tt>
       	<dd>
       Specifies the initial "Boltzmann factor" to be used by Monte Carlo
       routine.  The default value 0.1 &Aring;.  The higher the value the more
       likely that the routine will jump from any local minimum.  Use caution
       as very high values will produce jumps through the wall of the pore. 
       Generally its a good idea to do a number of initial exploratory runs with
       high values of MCDISP and MCKT if you have a channel with a complex
       network of routes.

	<p></p>
      	<dt><tt><b><big><a name=MCSTEP>MCSTEP integer</a></big></b></tt>
       	<dd>
       This card specifies the number of steps taken for the Metropolis Monte
       Carlo simulated annealing optimization routine.  
       The default value is 1000 steps which is normally adequate.

	<p></p>
      	<dt><tt><b><big><a name=RASEED>RASEED integer</a></big></b></tt>
       	<dd>
       This can be used to provide the random number generator used by the
       program an initial seed.  Normally the seed number is provided by a
       routine from the time of day.  HOLE will output the value of the seed it used.
       You can use this card if you want to repeat a run

	<p></p>
      	<dt><tt><b><big><a name=CHARMD>CHARMD filename</a></big></b></tt>
       	<dd>
	 Does multiple HOLE run on positions taken from <small>CHARMm</small>
	binary dynamics format .DCD trajectory file.  N.B. file must
	have exactly the same number of atoms in exactly the same order
	as the pdb file specified by the <a href="#COORD">COORD</a> card.
	Note that if this option is used the pdb file is used as
	a template only - the coordinates are ignored.  Note
	that structural parameters determined for each individual
	structure are written in a tagged format so that it is possible
	to extract the information from the text output file using
	a grep command. The reading of the file can be controlled by
	a CHARMS card.


	<p></p>
      	<dt><tt><b><big><a name=CHARMS>CHARMS integer integer</a></big></b></tt>
       	<dd>
	Controls reading of the	 <small>CHARMm</small>
	binary dynamics format .DCD trajectory file specified by the
	<a href="#CHARMD">CHARMD</a> card.  The first number is the number
	of positions to be skipped before analysis is to be performed.
	The second number is the number of positions to be skipped
	in between each analysis. <i>e.g.,</i> Suppose your
	.DCD file had a position written every 0.5ps and you wanted
	to analyze the run every 1 ps but ignoring the first 25ps
	(as this is equilibriation).  In this case use a line:<br>
	<tt>charms 49 2</tt>.


	<p></p>
      	<dt><tt><b><big><a name=2DMAPS>2DMAPS filename_root</a></big></b></tt>
       	<dd>
	This card is used to produce files which can be used to make 2d
	contour maps of the inside surface of a channel.  For full
	details <a href="hole_d065.html">see section 6.5</a>.  Note that this card is incompatible
	with a CAPSULE card.


	<p></p>
      	<dt><tt><b><big><a name=CAPSULE>CAPSULE</a></big></b></tt>
       	<dd>
	Turns on the capsule option. This analyzes the anisotropy of the channel.
	This also turns on a empirically corrected prediction of the conductance
	of the channel in KCl: see <a href="hole_d08.html">Section 8</a> for
	details.

<p>
<dt><a name=delete><h3>3.3 Cards which are deprecated</h3></a>

<b>These cards are currently recognized by the hole program but are deprecated.
   They were mainly used to directly produce molecular graphics output from hole:
   this is now done by using <a href="#SPHPDB">SPHPDB</a> output
   and the <a href="hole_d04.html#sph_process"><tt><b>sph_process</b></tt></a>
   program. 
   It is likely that these CARDS will be removed from the next (2.3) release of hole</b>

<small>
<small>
<dt><a name= MOLQPT> MOLQPT filename</a><dd>
	This facility is for people who do not use quanta but want to produce
	a composite picture of the <small>HOLE</small> surface with the molecule.  If you 
	specify a MOLQPT card then a quanta plot file will be written 
	with a stick representation of the molecule written to colour number
	1. This file can then be used with the file specified by a 
	<a href=#PLTOUT>PLTOUT</a> card to produce colour/monochrome
	hardcopy using the program <a href=hole_d07.html#qplot>qplot</a>.  
	Quanta users can produce more sophisticated versions such
	a file using the <i>plot molecules</i> option under the <i>file</i>
	menu. 

<dt><a name= PLTOUT> PLTOUT filename</a><dd>
        specifies the filename for binary 3D <small>QUANTA</small> plot file output.  It is normal
       to give the file the extension ".qpt" for compatibility with other programs. 
	The binary plot file will contain a graphical representation of the 
	hole run. It can be <a href="hole_d06.html#molgraph">directly 
	displayed in conjuction with the molecule using the 
	<small>QUANTA</small> program</a>,
       or can be converted for use with other programs 
	(see <a href="hole_d07.html#qpt_conv">qpt_conv</a>).
       If card is NOT present
       then no graphical output will be produced.  The file will contain records
       consisting of 4 real numbers.  If you are interested in other commands please
       consult Molecular Simulation documentation.  The commands
       used in hole and ancillary programs are:<p>
       <dl>
		<dt>1.0 x y z
		<dd>change to colour x.<br> 
		<i>Extension to standard format used by <small>HOLE</small></i>
		if y=-55 then z is an alternative colour number (in range 15
		to twenty).  The alternative colour number is used by 
		<a href="hole_d07.html#qplot">qplot</a>
		so that <small>HOLE</small> objects are output to different 
		colours: see
		<a href="hole_d06.html#hole_colour">colours used in <small>HOLE</small></a>

		<dd>...
		<dd>5 the label is centred on the atom
		<dd>...

		</dl>
		An easy way to remember what the integer means is to look at the 
		keypad of any keyboard:
<pre>789
456
123
</pre>  
		The use of this integer allows the production of pictures
		in which atom labels are not obscured by the molecule.  The

		the production of such labels. 	
       </dl><p>

<p>
<dt><a name= DOTDEN> DOTDEN integer</a><dd>
       This number controls the density of dots which will be used by the
       program.  A sphere of dots is placed on each centre determined in the
       Monte Carlo procedure.  Only dots which do not lie within any other
       sphere are considered.  The actual number of dots written if therefore
       controlled by dotden and sample.  Dotden should be set to between 5 (few
       dots per sphere) and 35 (large number of dots per sphere).  The default
       value is 10.
<p>

<dt><a name= DOTOFF > DOTOFF </a><dd>
       This card will turn off the drawing of a dot surface representation of the
       hole.  If not present then dot surface will be drawn.

<dt><a name= SPIKES > SPIKES </a><dd>
       The presence of this keyword will cause the program to produce spikes
       from the surfaces of spheres which go out until line hits an atom's surface
       rather than dots.  This is intended to be useful in looking at channels
       which are not locally cylindrically symmetrical.
<p>
<dt><a name= LINON > LINON </a><dd>
	This will turn on the drawing of lines joining each sphere surface to the
       	two closest atoms.  This can be use in showing which atoms cause
	constrictions in an ion channel.
       	In the previous version of <small>HOLE</small> the default option
       	was to draw closest atom lines and a LINOFF card was specified not to do
       	so - such a card is now ignored.
<p>
<dt><a name= CENOFF > CENOFF </a><dd>
       The presence of this flag will turn off the drawing of the locus of sphere
       centres as the <small>HOLE</small> sphere squeezes through the channel. 
	This line can be regarded as the centre line for the channel.  
	If a CENOFF card is not present the centre line will be output to
	the quanta plot file specified by the PLTOUT card.
<p>
<dt><a name= STOP> STOP </a><dd>
       Input of control data is stopped by reading an end of file or a "stop" card. 
       This card is included because in the good old days of VAX/VMS this was
       necessary.
