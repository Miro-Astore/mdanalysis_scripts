<a name=introduction><h3>2.0 Introduction & Setup</h3></a>

<a name=settingup><h3>2.1 Acquiring, Unpacking and setting up the package</h3></a>

<li>The HOLE suite is now distributed using the web from the 
    HOLE homepage on the web:
    <a href="http://hole.biop.ox.ac.uk/hole">http://hole.biop.ox.ac.uk/hole</a>
    follow the instructions there for the download.
<p>

<li>Download the compressed tar ball relevant for your system
    e.g., hole2.2_002_linux.tar.gz and place it in your home
    directory.

<li>Unpacking this tar ball will create the directory <tt>hole2</tt>
    containing files for your distribution. Use the commands:
<pre><b><font color=green>cd
tar xzf hole2.2_002_linux.tar.gz
</font></b>
</pre>
These commands will create the directories:
<br>
<tt><b>hole2/exe</b></tt> contains the main executables<br>
<tt><b>hole2/rad</b></tt> contains a the radius set files needed by hole <br>
<tt><b>hole2/examples</b></tt> contains a series of example input files for example
                        runs with hole. <br>
if you have a source code distribution (available by special request
see the hole homepage) there will also be a source directory <b><tt>hole2/src</tt></b>.

<br>
<br>
<li>To run the hole program and the other executables you can just type the 
full name of the program. To test that the executable works on your
computer by typing at the unix prompt:
<pre><b><font color=green>~/hole2/exe/hole</font></b>
 *** Program HOLE ***
  
 If results of this run are reported or published, please
 cite the publications listed below.

 <i>(edited for brevity)</i>
  Control variables read:
</pre>
The hole program should start and wait for input - hit ctrl-d (the control and
d keys together) to get out of this or ctrl-c to interupt.
If the program fails to load then please goto the hole homepage help section:
<a href="http://hole.biop.ox.ac.uk/hole/help">http://hole.biop.ox.ac.uk/hole/help</a>
<br>
<br>

<li>It is normally most convenient to add the hole executable directory to the
    the unix path (this would allow hole to be started by typing "hole").
    Suppose user "mary" has set up the package.  

<blockquote>
<ol>
    <li>If you are a tcsh or csh user add the following line at the end of your ~/.cshrc file 
<pre>
setenv PATH "$PATH":~mary/hole2/exe
</pre>

    <li>or otherwise if you are a bash user add the line that follows to
        the file that is used to set your ENV. This file is normally
        called following ~/.bash.profile or ~/.profile or ~/.kshrc
<pre>
PATH=$PATH:~mary/hole2/exe
</pre>
	(if unsure which shell you are running type <tt>echo $SHELL</tt>)
                                                                                              
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
<li>Open a new shell (if unsure about this logout and then log back into
    your terminal). You should be able to run the
    hole executables by typing the command name - try it out
    by typing <tt>hole</tt>  if nothing happens then make
    sure that you have permission to use the executables
    by typing <tt>"ls -l ~mary/hole2/exe"</tt>.
    If you cannot see this directory then go and speak to mary
    who should change the permissions for all the top hole2 directory
    (get her to type <tt>chmod a+rx ~/hole2</tt>).
<p>
<li>Unless you have installed hole in your own space you will need to
    modify the examples provided to point to the correct radius files.
    When specifying a file for vdw radii (using a <a href="hole_d03.html#RADIUS">
    RADIUS</a> card) you can use files in mary's area <i>e.g.,</i>
    specify the following line in the control file:<br>
    <tt>radius ~mary/hole2/rad/simple.rad</tt><br>
    (HOLE now resolves ~'s for user names).
</ul>

<a name=science><h3>2.2 Brief scientific background to the hole method </h3>

The first version of 
HOLE was written at Birkbeck College from April 1992 to allow the visualization
and analysis of the holes through atomic models of ion channels.  
At the time a number of
people have suggested that it may prove to be useful to other scientists working
on ion channel models and it was publicly distributed with that hope.  
This has proved to be true with many hundreds of downloads and literature
citations to date.
Its
initial application was to four experimentally determined structures of gramicidin
A, as described in Smart, Goodfellow and Wallace (1993).  Please refer to that
work for a detailed description of the method and discussion as to the results. 
This manual will concentrate on operational matters.<p>

The user must supply a file containing the co-ordinates for the ion channel
structure to be analyzed - in pdb format.  Atom records are read and the van der
Waals radius of each atom is set up. In the original version
the user had to supply an
initial point in the channel cavity and a vector in the rough direction of the
channel, now HOLE has the facility to make guesses for these.  
HOLE then proceeds to move the point on the plane normal to the
channel vector so as to find the largest sphere which can be accommodated 
without overlap with the van der Waals surface of any atom.  The optimization
is achieved by a Monte Carlo simulated annealing procedure.  This method was
initially chosen to avoid becoming trapped in local "minima" but has
subsequently proved to be useful in follow alternative routes through channels
with a complex internal cavity, such as annexin V (Smart, Wallace and
Goodfellow, 1993).  Once the largest sphere which can be accommodated on a
particular plane is found a small displacement is taken in the direction of the
channel vector and the process is repeated for the next plane.  The net result of
the routines is a series of sphere positions that can be thought of a flexible
sphere "squeezing" through the ion channel.<p>

Output from the procedure is in three forms:
<ol>
       <li>Numerical information as to the radius found is given vs distance
       along the channel is written to the text output file.  This can be input into
       a graph plotting program.
       <li>Graphical output is produced and output to a molecular graphics plot file.
       The original version of HOLE directly produced a HYDRA/QUANTA binary
       3D plot (.qpt) file.  This contained a dot surface showing the locus of the surface
       of the moving sphere and a line showing the locus for the sphere centre. 
       <!--Also available is an option which draws a line from the two atoms closest
       to each sphere surface to that surface.  This is intended to be useful in
       analyzing which atoms cause constrictions in the pore.-->  The file could be
       displayed together with the ion channel with the program QUANTA. Conversion
       programs were then developed to convert the qpt objects so they could be displayed
       with other molecular graphics programs, such as sybyl, rasmol, mage and  
       InsightII. The direct output of molecular graphics object is now phased
       out of HOLE (see next paragraph).

       <li>The sphere centre information is  output to a pdb format co-ordinate 
       file (normally given the terminal identifier .sph).  This contains an atom record 
       for each centre with the occupancies set to the sphere radii. 
       This file is now used to produce molecular graphics objects rather than
       directly producing them in HOLE. This has the advantage of allowing the
       separation of the process allowing the combination of the results
       of more than one  HOLE run and/or 
       This is useful for analysis of the route found using
       molecular graphics and combining the results of more that one run of
       HOLE.

<!--
The program is written in reasonably standard FORTRAN 77. An exception to this
is the use of machine specific random number generation routines. The original
pre-release program improved the poor nature of the vendor supplied random
numbers by using s/r RANO supplied in Numerical Recipes (1st ed., Press,
Flannery, Teukolsky and Vetterling, CUP, 1986).  This has been eliminated from
the released version to avoid problems of property rights.  I don't think this
should matter as the method does not need very good random numbers -
correlations should be of little consequence. -->

The program was originally written
on VAX under VMS and was then developed on an ibm rs6000 (under AIX). 
It has been used on a variety of Unix workstations (convex, SGI, HPI,
OSF1) it now primarily supported on linux.

<a name=newfeat><h3>2.4 New features for release 2.0</h3></a>

HOLE2 has a large number of new features which should both
ease the use of program and allow exploration of ion channel properties 
in further depth.  Most notably:
<dl>
<font color="#009900">
	<dt><img alt="*" src="ballbrwn.gif"> <b>(Release 2.002) 
	          2D Maps of the internal surface of a pore</b>
	<dd>This feature is now <a href="hole_d065.html">documented</a> 
	and the use of the public domain program gnuplot is supported.
</font>
<br><br>
	<dt><img alt="*" src="ballbrwn.gif"> <b>Speed</b>
	<dd>You should notice that the new version of HOLE runs about 30% faster
	as the calculation of unnecessary square root calculations have been eliminated.
	<dt><img alt="*" src="ballbrwn.gif"> <b>Text output flushing.</b>
	<dd>By default HOLE reads from the standard input (keyboard) and writes to the standard
	output.  For obvious reasons it is normal to redirect input and output to files 
	(using the &#60; and &#62;) keys.
	One annoying consequence of this on Silicon Graphics and Hewlett Packard's machines
	is that the text output arrives in "bursts" (caused by buffering the output).
	This release of HOLE gets around this problem by flushing the output periodically.
	Unfortunately there is no machine independent way of doing this so some
	work may be needed to get this to work for non-supported machines.	
	<dt><img alt="*" src="ballbrwn.gif"> <b>Reduced text output option.</b>
	<dd> 	<a href="hole_d03.html#SHORTO">SHORTO</a>
	<dt><img alt="*" src="ballbrwn.gif"> <b>Analysis of anisotropy</b>
	<dd> <a href="hole_d03.html#CAPSULE">CAPSULE</a>
	<dt><img alt="*" src="ballbrwn.gif"> <b>Prediction of K+ conductance</b>
	<dd>
	<dt><img alt="*" src="ballbrwn.gif"> <b>Better graphics</b>
	<dt><img alt="*" src="ballbrwn.gif"> <b>Colour coding surfaces</b>
	<dt><img alt="*" src="ballbrwn.gif"> <b>Better support for non-QUANTA users</b>
	<dd>With conversions programs added for O, mage, rasmol and VRML.
	<dt><img alt="*" src="ballbrwn.gif"> <b>Easy analysis of multiple files <i>e.g.,</i>  from Molecular Dynamics trajectories.</b>
	<dd> Instead of HOLE being limited to the analysis of one input coordinate 
	file it is now easy to apply HOLE to many input coordinate sets. This is
	achieved by specifying a wildcard (*) in the file name specified after the
	<a href="hole_d03.html#COORD">COORD</a> card, <i>e.g.,</i> <tt>coord ab*.pdb</tt>
        will apply hole to all files in the directory whose name starts with <tt>ab</tt> and
        ends with <tt>.pdb</tt>.  The hole procedure will
        be applied to each file in turn with the same setup conditions (initial
	point, sampling distance etc.).<p>

	As well as being able to read from multiple pdb files HOLE
	can now read from <small>CHARMm</small> .DCD format binary
	trajectory files.  Details of this option can be found
	by looking at the <a href="hole_d03.html#CHARMD">CHARMD</a>
	and <a href="hole_d03.html#CHARMS">CHARMS</a> cards.

	<dt><img alt="*" src="ballbrwn.gif"><b> Program <a href="hole_d07.html#qplot">qplot</a> is now much easier
	to use and produces shorter postscipt files.</b>
	<dd> qplot allows the user to produce high quality colour or monochrome
	postscript files of HOLE objects.  In the original release the program
	was difficult to use.  The program is now much more user friendly 
	and has sensible defaults. For instance you can produce pictures
	with views along the x or y axis very much more easily.
