<a name="ancillary"><h2>7.0 Ancillary programs</h2></a>

All the programs described in this section are designed to be run interactively. 
If you followed the <a href="hole_d02.html#settingup">setup</a> instruction
you should be able to start the programs by typing the command at you
normal unix prompt.
All the programs
ask a series of questions to which you can type a reply.  Wherever possible a
default option is provided, this is indicated in angle brackets <>.  For example
when a program wants a quanta plot file name (which already exists) it will ask:
<pre>
       Please enter input binary quanta plot (old) filename
       defaults &lt;example.qpt&gt;ext:&lt;.qpt&gt; (abort by EXIT or ^D): 
</pre>
where example.qpt is the newest file with extension .qpt in the current directory.  
If you just hit enter then the filename shown will be used.
However, if a reply of "file1" is given the
program will try to open a file with the name "file1.qpt" and if that fails will try just "file1" 
but if a reply of "file2.dat" is given an attempt will be made to open file2.dat.
Note that you can now use ~'s in filenames to refer to peoples home directories
(<i>e.g.,</i> <tt>~mary/hello.txt</tt> refers to a file  <tt>hello.txt</tt> in
user <tt>mary</tt>'s home directory). 
If you wish to abort the question enter "exit" (either case) or hit ctrl_D.  
Normally "abort" stops
the execution of a program completely but sometimes I use this to jump out of
a loop e.g. in asking for multiple input files.  Generally you can get any of these
programs to abort by entering ctrl_D at any question (if you have setup HOLE
on a non-unix machine then the EOF character is often ctrl-Z).

<a name=qpt_conv><h3>7.1 qpt_conv</h3></a>

This is a utility program which converts the .qpt (quanta plot file format program)
into another format. Start it by typing <tt>qpt_conv</tt>. You should see the following

	edited it should be converted back using this option.
	Also useful when you wish to use a qpt file created on
	one machine on another with a different architecture -
	which stores binary files in a different order.
	This option replaces hydasc program of original HOLE.  <p>

	You can use this option to convert all the dot records in a quanta
	3D binary plot file (.qpt) to 3D crosses (like a cross in 2D but 
	with a third cross bar).  These should then be quite visable.
	Note the sensible default for the output .qpt filename.  
	You are prompted for the size of the cross bar to be used - 
	the default of 0.1 angs gives small crosses
	which show up well in <tt>quanta</tt>.  Note that using
	this option will considerably increase the size of the 
	graphics file (it take 6 records to draw a 3d cross cf
	to one for a dot).  Also note that <a href="#qplot">qplot</a>

<a name=sphqpt><h3>7.2 sphqpt</h3></a>

Occasionally you may wish to add the result of two or more HOLE runs together
and view the overall surface (as done for annexin V in Smart, Wallace and
Goodfellow, 1993).  You can use program sphqpt to do this.  It can also be
used to change the dot density of a result without rerunning the whole procedure
or edit out unwanted parts of a run.  The program reads a '.sph' file.  This is a
file containing information about the sphere centres determined in HOLE which
is in pdb format (with the radius determined lurking as an occupancy.  The file
is output by HOLE if a 'sphpdb' card is present (see section 3.0).  sphqpt asks
for and reads in a '.sph' file and opens a QUANTA format 3D binary plot file
(.qpt).  The program asks the user to supply a dot density (as explain in 'dotden'
section 3.0).  The program then proceeds to produce an overall dot surface for
all the sphere centres read.  Optionally the sphere centre line is also written.
<p>
When editing the .sph file (or files) bear in mind that the sphqpt needs to
known when an 'end' sphere centre has been reached.  It does this by detecting
breaks in the residue numbering in the pseudo-pdb file.  If you are doing
something relatively sophisticated you may have to play about a bit to achieve
your desired aim.
<p>

<hr size=2>
<a name=qplot><h3>7.3 qplot</h3></a>


This is a very much larger program than the previous two.  It is intended to
allow the production of publication quality stereo diagrams of QUANTA plot files,
in particular the results of HOLE.  The program outputs postscript files suitable
for printing on a postscript printer.  The initial version was written in
collaboration with Valeriu Niculae, a student doing a vocational course in
computing with work experience at Birkbeck.  Subsequently it has been
substantially rewritten with support for colour postscript printers and simple
depth queuing.  The program is a bit of a mess and unfortunately I do not have
the time to revise it.  I hope that you find it useful and not too much of a pain. 
If you find things difficult persevere as the output is quite pretty.
<p>

The program asks a series of questions which you answer to produce an output
file.  The first question sets the level of complication of the questions to be
asked.  There are three levels: "amateur" gives very little control (defaults are
used for practically everything), "normal" gives more control (for instance
allowing the image to be rotated and "expert" level allows you to control
everything.  To produce output of the form shown in Smart, Goodfellow and
Wallace (1993) follow this brief outline.  Before running qplot you must have
the following files ready:
(i)    the .qpt file output from HOLE preferably before it has been put through
       qptdot.
(ii)   A QUANTA plot file of the part of your ion channel you wish to display. 
       Generate this using the "generate plots" option under the file menu in
       QUANTA.  Make sure you select the "stick plot" option from the "identity
       matrix" view.  If you wish all the molecule to appear as one line type
       make sure that you are displaying it as one colour before this.
(iii)  If you wish to have a hard copy from a view other than the identity then
       use QUANTA to select a view and write it to a view file (using the option
       "save view" under the "view" menu the default extension is .vew).   At
       present only the rotation matrix in the view file is used.  In the future I
       may introduce a feature to read the other data so clipping and scaling
       could also be used.
(iv)   Prepare any labels you wish to place on the picture by using program
       qptlab (see section 7.4).
Then run qplot by typing qplot at the command line.  As you want to read two
.qpt files (the stick plot and the HOLE output) you must select the "expert" level. 
Enter the filename for the stick plot and hit return, answer the subsequent
question until asked for the next filename when you should enter the name for
the HOLE output .qpt file).  When asked for yet another filename enter ctrl_D to
jump out of the loop.  I hope that the rest of the questions asked should be
fairly self explanatory.  Please also refer to the example_doc.* in the example
directory for an example of the programs use.
<p>

The stereo output option produces a picture of reasonable size to be view
through normal stereo glasses (with lenses) and for publication.  I have produced
pretty stereo pictures for a poster on an A3 colour postscript printer by editing
the output postscript file and adding the line "1.7 1.7 scale -50 -50 translate" to
the top of the file.  If you want to scale the picture try something along this line.

<a name=labqpt><h3>7.4 labqpt</h3></a>


This little program allows the user to produce a quanta 3D binary plot file
containing labels for chosen atoms.  It was called qptlab in the previous release
but labqpt seems more logical! The program reads in a .pdb co-ordinate file
and ask for the user to name an atom (giving atom name and residue number). 
It then asks the user to enter a label to be written at the atom's position (with
the default of the atom name and residue number).  Furthermore the user is
asked for a "positioning integer".  This is integer is written to the quanta plot
file and is interpreted by program qplot - if the integer is:
1 the label is placed below the atom to the left
2 the label is centred below the atom
...
5 the label is centred on the atom
...
9 the label is placed above the atom to the right.
An easy way to remember what the integer means is to look at the keypad of
any keyboard.  Note that this control integer is an extension to the QUANTA
format so that other programs will not recognize it.  For an example of the use
of the program see example_doc.*.

<a name=vdwdot><h3>7.5 vdwdot</h3></a>

This program calculates the "internal" van der Waals dot surface for a given 
molecule.  The technique used is to consider a number of dots isotropically
distributed around each atom at the van der Waals radii for the atom.  A dot is
only output if it lies outside the van der Waals radius of every other atom.  In
addition a test is made to see whether the dot is "internal".  A dot is defined 
as internal if it meets the following test.  Extend the dot to a line pointing from
the centre of the atom to infinity.  If this line crosses any atom then the dot is
"internal".  Simply put a dot is internal if it opposes some other atom's surface. 
(In fact the test is slightly different to this but very difficult to explain in
words!).
<p>
vdwdot is intended to complement HOLE by allowing the visualization of the full
internal van der Waals surface without the outer surface complicating things. 
It could be used before HOLE to gain a broad idea of the shape of the inside of
a pore before starting detailed analysis.  Alternatively it can be used in
conjunction with the surface produced by HOLE to see parts of the internal cavity
not revealed by the HOLE process.  The same values of van der Waals radii can
(and should!) be used in vdwdot and HOLE.
<p>
Unlike the other ancillary programs in the HOLE suite, vdwdot can be quite cpu
intensive.  It is therefore controlled like HOLE with a keyworded entry - so that
it can easily be run in the background.  A number of the cards are in common:
<dl>

       <dt>COORD fname          
       <dd>The file containing the co-ordinates of the molecule in
                            Brookhaven protein databank format. MUST be
                            specified. <p>                       
       <dt>RADIUS fname     <dd>    The van der Waals radius filename to be used.  MUST
                            be specified.<p>
       <dt>PLTOUT fname         <dd>The filename for graphical (.qpt) output of the dots. 
                            The dots will be assigned to colour 6.  MUST be
                            specified.<p>
       <dt>DOTDEN integer       <dd>The control integer for the density of dots to be used
                            by the program.  See section 3.2 above for more
                            details.  For large molecules avoid using high values
                            as this will result in very slow execution and large
                            files.  Default value is 10.<p>
</dl>
<p>
One new card has been introduced in the program:
<dl>
      <dt> DCUT real_no        <dd> This card can be used to save time in the program. 
                            The program will only check to see whether a dot
                            overlaps/opposes a given atom if the distance between
                            atom centres is less than the sum of the van der Waals
                            radii and dcut.  When the maximum radius of a
                            channel is known from HOLE dcut should be set to
                            over twice this value.  The default value is 10
                            angstroms.  A special feature is that if dcut is set to
                            zero then the full van der Waals surface is produced -
                            i.e. no check is made to see whether a dot is internal.
