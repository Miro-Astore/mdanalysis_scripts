<h2>8.0  Using HOLE to predict conductance properties of ion channels</h2>

This is a major new feature in release 2.  The science behind the method is
described in:

	(1997) 
	<dd>A novel method for structure-based prediction of ion channel conductance
	properties. Biophys. J. (March issue). <p> 
	<dd><i>or</i> A brief description can be found in the J. Mol. Graphics paper 
	included in this documentation as

This section will concentrate on the practicalities of 
how to perform conductance prediction
calculations on your system.

<a name="abscond"><h3>8.1 Absolute conductance predictions in KCl</h3>

The following input file is taken for one of the runs which was used
to parameterize the correction functions used to make empirical
corrections to the macroscopic expected conductance calculated by HOLE.
For meaningful corrections the conditions used should be followed
reasonably carefully.
<pre>
! calculate conductivity for porin
coord pdb1omf.pdb               ! Co-ordinates
radius ~/hole2/rad/simple.rad
cvect  0 0 1                    ! channel runs approx up Z axis
cpoint -1.17 49.45 33.72        ! point in pore

shorto 1
mcdisp 0.4
mcstep 10000

</pre>

<u>Notes:</u><p>
<bl>
<li>The prediction routines are turned on as part of the 
<a href="hole_d03.html#CAPSULE">capsule</a> option
which measures the anisotropy of a channel.<p>

<li>You MUST use the non-united atom AMBER van der Waals radii set included as
simple.rad.<p>

<li>You must exclude from consideration all waters, ions etc. within
your channel (done with an <a href="hole_d03.html#IGNORE">ignore</a>  card here).<p>

<li>The <a href="hole_d03.html#MCSTEP">mcstep</a>  10000 means 
that ten times as many steps as normal are
done in the Monte Carlo Optimization.  Although this results in long
runs on all but the fastest work station it is necessary to achieve
consistent results (in terms of area) between runs.  If you are doing
multiple files (e.g. averaging the result along a dynamics run) then
you can reduce the number to 3000 but I wouldn't go any lower.<p>

<li>The value of sample should not be critical but I would use 0.25 for
consistency.<p>

<li>The value of <a href="hole_d03.html#MCDISP">mcdisp</a>  should be set to about 1/10th of the minimum 
effective radius of the channel you are looking at.<p>

<li>The <a href="hole_d03.html#SPHPDB">SPHPDB</a> card 
produces a file which you can use with the sphqpt
program to visually check the performance of HOLE at the end of the
run.  It is a good idea to do this to make sure the program is not
doing anything silly.<p>

<li>Results of the conductance prediction are reported at the end of normal
HOLE output (written to standard output but normally 
<a href="hole_d03.html#reass">redirected</a> to a file). 
These are reasonably self-explanatory.  This output is taken from  run on 
porin 1omf using input file above.  The run took at total of 1hour 10mins
cpu on an IRIX indigo2 R4400:
<pre>
 The geometric factor F= sum(ds/area) along channel is    0.344 angstroms**-1
 This yields a macroscopic predicted molar conductance of:
   (1/rho)*(100/F)= (290/rho) pS,
   where rho is the conductivity of 1M permeant ion in ohm m.
 For 1M KCl rho= 1/12 (ohm m), So Gmacro= 3500 pS/M.
 Empirically derived correction factors:
    first generation (2 system) on MINRAD=      4.97989
    2nd generation (8 system) constant=         5.59400
    2nd generation on length of channel=        5.80046
    2nd generation on avg elect potential=      6.14517
      0.00000

    first generation (2 system) on MINRAD= 700 pS/M.
    2nd generation (8 system) constant=    620 pS/M.
    2nd generation on length of channel=   600 pS/M.
    2nd generation on avg elect potential= 570 pS/M.
 
  As a single estimate take average of last 3 so Gpred= 600 pS/M.
 N.B., The predicted conductances given above are only
       a crude estimate and should not be over interpreted!
</pre>
The experimental conductance of 1omf in 1M KCl is 700 pS (the calculated 
result is not that surprising considering this was included in the 
parameterization of the model!).<p>

<li>If you want to make a prediction for an ionic concentration other than
1M then simply multiply the predicted conductances by the molar concentration
wanted (i.e. for 0.5M KCl multiply all the numbers by 0.5). <p>
  
<li>Please let me know how you get on.

<a name="PEG"><h3>8.2 Predicting the effect of adding non-electrolytes to
conductance experiments</h3>

The science behind this is explained in the 
<a href="#smart97">Smart et al. (1997)</a> paper.
The calculation routines are started by a PEGRAT card:
<pre>pegrat 0.54 1.18 ! produce PEG graph * 20% PEG</pre>
The numbers following the card specify the value of theta_NON and 
theta_PEG as defined in <a href="#smart97">Smart et al. (1997)</a>.
The <a href="hole_d03.html#CAPSULE">capsule</a> option cannot be used with
this.  <strong><blink>The calculations are in a very early state of
development.  Please get in touch with me if you are interested in
using these.  YOU MUST CHECK WITH ME BEFORE YOU PUBLISH ANY RESULTS USING
THIS ROUTINE.</blink></strong>
