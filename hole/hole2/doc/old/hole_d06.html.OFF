<a name="graph2D"><h3>6.1 Plotting 2D Graphs</h3>

***to be updated***<p>

One of the more useful ways to visualize the results of HOLE is to plot a graph
(all those school teachers/university demonstrators must have some influence). 
Raw data which can be used for this purpose is written at the end of the text
output file.  This can be read into your favourite graph plotting program (I use
sigmaplot).  Clearly the pore radius determined should be placed on the y axis. 
For the x-axis you can either use the distance moved along the pore centre-line
from the initial point (the first column of the data) or the x, y or z co-ordinates
of the sphere centre (if the pore lies approximately in one of these directions). 
The former representation gives an indication of the straightness of the pore but
comparison between runs is made more difficult by side to side jumps in the
centre line.  The latter representation, which was suggested by Mark Samson,
is probably preferable as it allows easy comparison between the results of
different runs and for the position of important atoms/residues to be marked on
the graph. <p>

	The QUANTA 3D binary file .qpt can be displayed using QUANTA (or if you
	have ancient E & S ps300's its predecessor HYDRA).  The procedure for
	this is first to import the pdb file of your channel into the QUANTA
	(so that you can see it).  Then use your mouse to select the option
	"Create objects" (under the heading draw).  You are then confronted
	with a "dialogue box" asking for what type of object: select "quanta
	plot file" and a name for the object.  The molecule and the hole
	through will then be displayed in conjunction.  <p>

	You may find that the dots of the dot surface do not show up very 
	well in QUANTA.  If this is the case you can use program 
	<a href="hole_d07.html#qpt_conv">qpt_conv (see section 7.1)</a> to

	<dd>Kinemage is a protein display and viewing language developed
	by David Richardson.  Kinemages can be viewed by the mage
	program which is available in versions for MS-windows, mac
	and various unix machines.  Kinemages can be prepared from
	a pdb file by using the prekin program.  Both programs are
	public domain and very easy to use.  If you do not have
	access to a "proper" molecular graphics program or
	want to use HOLE on a low performance machine (<i>i.e.,</i>
	PC or mac) then I recommend you use this program.
	A page on the PPS'96 protein structure course <a href=
	"http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/PPS2/technology/kinemage.html">
	gives details</a> where to get copies or try David Richardson's 
	<a href="ftp://suna.biochem.duke.edu/pub/">ftp site</a>.<p>

	The first step is to produce a .qpt file of a HOLE run
	using a <a href="hole_d03.html#PLTOUT">PLTOUT card</a> in hole, 
	or using the program <a href="hole_d07.html#sphqpt">sphqpt</a>

	The .qpt file must then be converted into a form suitable for 
	use with mage. Use program 
	<a href="hole_d07.html#qpt_conv">qpt_conv</a> 
	(with the option <b>"K"</b>)  to produce .kin file.
	This file will contain kinemage instructions for the HOLE
	objects alone.  To view the HOLE objects in conjunction
	with the molecule then you should use an editor
	to merge this file with the output of <tt>prekin</tt> (if you
	are doing this under ms-windows then use <tt>write</tt> rather
	than <tt>notepad</tt> as the editor as the files are large).
        To get decent rotation rates one must reduce the number
	of lines to be drawn on a screen - so either turn off
	all HOLE objects when adjusting the view or make
	sure you use a low dot density (set by a 
	<a href="hole_d03.html#DOTDEN">DOTDEN card</a> or in sphqpt).
	Depending on the machine the lines drawn can be rather
	thick - if this is the case try turning on the "thin line"
	option in the "Options menu.
	Note that mage can produce side by side stereo so if you
	can see stereo directly then put this option on or otherwise
	try to get a pair of <b>mirror</b> type stereo glasses.<p>

<a name="insight"><dt><b><img alt="*" src="ballbrwn.gif"> InsightII</b>
	<dd>The first step is to produce a .qpt file of a HOLE run
	using a <a href="hole_d03.html#PLTOUT">PLTOUT card</a> in hole, 
	or using the program <a href="hole_d07.html#sphqpt">sphqpt</a>
	with a .sph file produced by a 
	<a href="hole_d03.html#SPHPDB">SPHPDB card</a> in HOLE (the hole
	surface can be produced as a grid and colour coded using this option.<p>


        The .qpt file must then be converted into a form suitable for
        use with InsightII. Use program
        <a href="hole_d07.html#qpt_conv">qpt_conv</a>
        with the option <b>"I"</b>.  Unfortunately I no longer
	have access to a copy of the program so the conversion program
	is unaltered from release 1 of HOLE - in which there was little
	colour coding.  Here are the notes from the previous release:<p>

<i>the routine writes out a Biosym Insight II
special user format file (.usr). This should allow display of the dot surface and lines produced by HOLE with InsightII.
There are some differences between the file formats. A single .usr file can contain only dots or lines - not both. Therefore
you must run the program twice to convert a typical .qpt file produced by HOLE. Also because the .usr file format for text
records essentially only allow one record per file I haven't bother to convert these. Also the control of colour is very
different between the two formats. A LINE .usr file does not have any facility for changing colour in the file - all records
from the .qpt file will therefore be displayed in a single colour. If you don't like this you will have to use an editor to split
up the files. The DOT .usr file allows the specification of a different colour for each dot (by a number between 0 an 360).
At present all dots are given the same colour which can be specified by the user. To display the dot surface (or line objects)
first read in your molecule (from pdb file or similar) and then use the option "get" under the menu "user" to specify the .usr
file produced by qpt_insight. The "Reference_object" option should be "on" to avoid the object being centred. 

From an
extremely preliminary use it appears that InsightII suffers from much the same problem as QUANTA in that dots do not
show up as being very bright - so it may be worth using program 
	<a href="hole_d07.html#qpt_conv">qpt_conv (see section 7.1)</a> to 
	convert the dots to small crosses (a new .qpt file is produced).  <p>
<p>
<b>If you want to use colour coding etc. then the subroutine qptins
 will need updating - either does this yourself or e-mail me so that
 I can do it and you can test it </b>

<a name="rasmol"><dt><b><img alt="*" src="ballbrwn.gif">
	 rasmol <img alt="*" align=center src="ras_icon_t.gif"></b>
	<dd>Rasmol is a very popular molecular viewer written by Roger
	Sayle of <a href="http://www.glaxowellcome.co.uk/">Glaxo Wellcome</a>.
	It is free and available in versions for pc's, mac's, unix-boxes and vms,
	for further information see 
	<a href="http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/">The Rasmol
	Homepage</a>. Note that to be able to use rasmol with HOLE you need
	to use version 2.6 (version 2.5 will not work).  You can download
	rasmol from a number of places (see 
	<a href="http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/">The Rasmol
        Homepage</a>), for instance 
	<a href="ftp://ftp.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pub/rasmol/v2.6beta/">Edinburgh</a>.<p>
	
	Unfortunately rasmol does not have any way to import graphical objects
	as distinct from atoms.  A work around (suggested by Roger Sayle)
	is to treat the objects as atoms in a pdb file and use "CONECT" 
	records to join them up.  (Another annoying thing is that rasmol
	will rework out bonds if there is not at least one bond per atom -
	which means that each move draw has to be represented by 3 lines not
	one!) There is yet a further complication -
	you cannot just append the resulting "object pdb-file" to the end
	of the molecule's pdb file as rasmol will then work out
	a new bonding list based on distance (and a mess will result!).
	At present the only way to see the molecule and hole object
	is to use the <a href="hole_d03.html#MOLQPT">MOLQPT</a> card to produce a
	stick plot of the molecule and concatinate the result with the
	HOLE object .qpt (from HOLE or sphqpt).  This can be converted into
	a pseudo-pdb file for rasmol.  Note one loses all atom information
	on the molecule this way.  It would be possible to be more smart
	about this but it may not be necessary as new versions of
	rasmol which can read more than one molecule in are being developed
	which may avoid the problem.  This example (run in ~/hole2/example)
	shows how you can use it:

	VRML is supported in two ways by HOLE.  The first is an option

The graphical output of HOLE is in the form of a .qpt file - QUANTA
binary plot format.  The format of the file is described in the
