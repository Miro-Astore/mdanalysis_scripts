<h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>

In excess of a third of the proteins found in the yeast genome are
thought to be membrane-integral<sup><a href="refer.html#walker">1</a></sup>.
Ion channels are important class of membrane proteins<sup><a href="refer.html#hille">2</a></sup>.  These proteins allow
the translocation of ions across the hydrophobic barriers presented by
lipid bilayers, and are often gated by the action of voltage gradients
or the binding of small ligand molecules (such as neurotransmitters).
<p>

Despite the obvious interest ion channels there are a limited
number of structural studies currently available<sup><a href="refer.html#walker">1</a></sup>.
  This is principally due to the difficulty
in structure determination of integral membrane proteins, both by crystallographic
and NMR methods.  In contrast to this, membrane proteins provide an attractive target
for modelling studies.  In part this is because of the limited possibility
of main chain groups forming hydrogen bonds with solvent in the lipid
environment.  As a consequence there is a restriction in the number of
secondary structures available<sup><a href="refer.html#montal">3</a></sup>.  
Modelling provides an attractive option in adding value to 
mutagenesis<sup><a href="refer.html#adams">4</a></sup> or
low resolution structural studies such as by electron 
microscopy<sup><a href="refer.html#sankar">5</a></sup>.
<p>

The increasing number of experimental and modelling studies on channels 
led us to identify the need for
dedicated methods for analysing important structural 
features<sup><a href="refer.html#smart93">6</a></sup>.
In particular all current structures of channels have a
cavity running through them.  This cavity or pore is normally 
filled with solvent and provides the pathway for ion translocation.
<p>

Many methods exist for looking at the surface of proteins and
cavities inside them.  Most molecular graphics programs have 
routines for displaying the van der Waals surface of molecules
and often can display the solvent accessible surface, as pioneered by
Connolly<sup><a href="refer.html#connolly">7</a></sup>.   
Specialised methods exist for isolating cavities within
proteins, notably the commonly used 
voido<sup><a href="refer.html#kleywegt">8</a></sup> method and 
proact<sup><a href="refer.html#williams">9</a></sup> which introduces
a powerful classification method.  Recently a method which concentrates
on analysing pockets on the surface of proteins thus allowing easy
identification of active sites has been
developed<sup><a href="refer.html#laskowski">10</a></sup> .  Although all
the methods could potentially be used to analyse ion channels, 
the specialised nature of the molecules makes a dedicated
set of routines desirable.
<p>
This paper summarises work on the program <small>HOLE</small>
which concentrates on analysing the dimensions of the pores
running through molecules.  Recent 
developments<sup><a href="refer.html#smart96">11</a></sup> allowing
the analysis of anisotropy and prediction of conductance
properties are described.  As an example an analysis is then made of
the pore properties of cholera toxin B<sub>5</sub>.
