HOLE and ancillary programs are supplied with source code free to non-profit
making organizations.  This is on the understanding that they will not be passed
on to any third party.  If any one wants to use the program get them to contact
me - this will help me keep a list of users to be informed about developments,
bugs etc..  Also details of any modification/improvement made must be sent to
me - so that everyone else can benefit 
(all rights to modified versions of any of
the programs will remain with the author and Birkbeck College).  It should be
noted that the code and notes are at an early stage of development and therefore
the responsibility for their use and correctness of results lies with the 
user rather
than me or Birkbeck College.  You may incorporate any of the routines supplied
in software of your own provided: (a) I am notified and (b) the complete
software is supplied free to any non-profit making organization.
<p>

If anyone else has access to the code/executables mounted in your
space then <b>it is your responsibility</b> to ensure that they abide
by these conditions.

<p>
You must reference any use made of HOLE in published work by citing:
