<h2>3. Example application to cholera toxin B subunit
     pentamer</h2>
     
Cholera toxin is a protein of molecular weight of approximately
84 kD and is responsible for the massive loss of fluids
characteristic of the disease by altering the transport of
salt and fluids across the intestinal 
epithelium<sup><a href="refer.html#tosteson">22</a></sup>.  The intact
protein is a heterohexamer composed of five B-subunits with
a single A-subunit<sup><a href="refer.html#zhang">23</a></sup>. 
Recently X-ray crystal structures of both
the intact heterohexamer<sup><a href="refer.html#meritt">19</a></sup> and 
the B<sub>5</sub> homopentamer<sup><a href="refer.html#zhang">22</a></sup> 
have been determined.   Structures of the hexamer show that a
ring of B-subunits form a central "donut hole" which is filled
with the A2 alpha-helix from the A subunit.  However, the B-subunits
can form a stable complex which is similar except that the central
hole is empty.  Krasilnikov and co-workers have 
shown<sup><a href="refer.html#krasilnikov">21</a></sup> that
this pentamer is able to form ion channels in artificial membranes at low pH.
It remains unclear as to whether the ability of the toxin to
form ion channels has any role in its pathological
mechanism of action<sup><a href="refer.html#zhang">23</a></sup>.
<p>
An examination of the pore dimensions of the crystal structure
for the cholera toxin B subunit pentamer was conducted using
<small>HOLE</small>.  It has been suggested that the A-subunit
which must translocate through the membrane as part of its
mode of toxicity may do so by passing through the channel formed
by the B subunit pentamer<sup><a href="refer.html#krasilnikov">21</a></sup> .
  However, it has been noted that the pore found in the crystal structures is not sufficiently large
to allow such a motion<sup><a href="refer.html#zhang">23</a></sup> and that
there may be some rearrangement of the pentamer on incorporation into
the membrane.  It is therefore interesting to examine whether the
crystal structure is compatible with the conductance data available
- if it is then such a rearrangement may be excluded.
<p>
The structure examined is the 2.2&Aring;  resolution structure
solved by Merritt et al.<sup><a href="refer.html#merritt">19</a></sup>:<br>

The pore dimensions of the channel as calculated by <small>HOLE</small> 
show a pore which is sufficiently large to be accommodate two water molecules side by
side at any place within the channel.

This can also be seen by plotting a graph of pore radius versus distance

</center><p>
Comparison of the minimum effective pore radius found with that of the porin
family is instructive:

     <td>cholera toxin B<sub>5</sub><sup><a href="refer.html#merritt">19</a></sup></
td>
     <td align=center>3.24</td>
     </tr>


</table>
</center>

Both the porins and the maltoporin allow translocation of molecules up
to the size of a ketose carbohydrate<sup><a href="refer.html#jap">24</a></sup>.
  As the minimum radius for
cholera toxin B<sub>5</sub> is in the same range
it is expected that it would allow the translocation of solutes
of around this size.  In terms of being able to translocate
a protein domain the size of the A-subunit of cholera toxin, this
confirms the observation<sup><a href="refer.html#zhang">23</a></sup>
that
the crystal structure is incompatible with this, unless
the domain was unfolded prior to translocation.<p>

<p><a name=peggraphback></a>
This begs the question; is there a possibility of a conformational rearrangement 
of the B pentamer, 
with a widening of the pore,
on incorporation into a lipid bilayer as postulated
by Zhang<sup><a href="refer.html#zhang">23</a></sup>?  
If the <small>HOLE</small>
prediction of the conductance of the crystal structure was
significantly smaller than the experimentally found conductance
this would be indicative of such a change.  In fact the
predicted conductance is consistent with the experimental value
<sup><a href="refer.html#smart96">11</a></sup>
so it would appear that a conformational rearrangement is unlikely.
This conclusion is further strengthened by comparing the 
prediction for the expected profile of a PEG addition experiment
with that found:
<center><a href="peg_graph.html"><img src="peg_graphi.gif" align=bottom><br>
	<small><i>(click to see picture full size)</i></small></a><br>
</center><p>
It can be seen that according to the <small>HOLE</small> calculation the
crystal structure is in fact compatible with the effect on conductance data.
Thus the possibility of a significant conformational arrangement
accompanying the incorporation of cholera toxin B<sub>5</sub> can
be seen to be unlikely.  This does not necessarily mean that the
proposed translocation of the A-subunit through the B pentamer
does not occur, only that such a motion would involve
a considerable alteration to the structure of either or both
the A-subunit and the  B pentamer.
