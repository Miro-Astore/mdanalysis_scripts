<h2>2. Methods</h2>


<a name=mc</a>
<h4><small>HOLE</small> Monte Carlo Simulated Annealing</h4>

The <small>HOLE</small> method has been described in detail 
elsewhere<sup><a href="refer.html#smart93">6</a>, 
<a href="refer.html#smart96">11</a></sup>. 
The program requires the user to supply the coordinates of the ion channel
of interest in Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (pdb) format.  
An initial point  <i><b>p</b></i> which lies anywhere within the central
channel is also needed.  In addition the user specifies a vector <i><b>v</b></i> that is approximately in the direction
of the channel (normally referred to as the channel direction vector).
The program reads atoms from within the pdb file and sets up
a van der Waals radius for each (various sets are available).
It is normal to exclude solvent and ions during the read: the
program allows this by the specification of a keyword stating the
residue types to ignore.<p>

It is easy to find the maximum radius <i>R(<b>p</b>)</i> of a sphere
centred at a point <i><b>p</b></i> without overlap
with the van der Waals surface of any atom:

<center><i>
R(<b>p</b>) = min<sub>i=1</sub><sup>Natom</sup>
<big>[</big>|<b>X</b><sub>i</sub>-<b>p</b>|-
             vdW<sub>i</sub><big>]</big>
</i></center>
where <i><b>X</b><sub>i</sub></i> is the position of atom number <i>i</i>,
<i>vdW<sub>i</sub></i> its van der Waals radius and <i>Natom</i> the total 
number of atoms.  The radius <i>R(<b>p</b>)</i> can be regarded as an objective function
of the point <i><b>p</b></i>.  By using Monte Carlo simulated annealing,
adjusting <i><b>p</b></i>, the radius
of the sphere can be maximized within the pore of the channel.  In all cases
<i><b>p</b></i> is kept on a plane normal to the channel direction vector
<i><b>v</b></i>:

Note that all distance searches are conducted in three dimensions.
Once the highest radius sphere centre on a particular plane has been
established a new search is initiated by taking a step of length
<i>s</i> in the direction of the channel direction vector <i><b>v</b></i>.
This results in searches being conducted for a series of parallel planes
with a sphere of maximum radius being found for each:
<center><img src="mc2.gif" align=bottom></center>
The net result can be thought of as producing the locus of
a flexible sphere "squeezing" through the centre of the ion channel.
The use of Monte Carlo Simulated Annealing reduces the possibility of
the routine getting stuck in a local minimum. In addition it allows
the mapping out of complex internal topologies (such as annexin 
V<sup><a href="refer.html#smart94">12</a></sup>) 
using multiple runs. <p>

A <a href="flow.html">flow chart</a> giving a detailed description of
the basic <small>HOLE</small> method is available.<p>
<a name=visual1back></a>
<h4>Visualization methods</h4>

There are a number of ways to analyze and visualize the results of
a <small>HOLE</small> run.  One of the most useful is plot a
graph of pore radius against coordinate <i>z</i> along the channel
direction vector <i><b>v</b></i>:
<center><a href="visual1.html"><img src="visual1i.gif" align=bottom></a></center> 
A graph can be used to examine issues such as how tight the central constriction
of the channel is, whether water molecules could fit within the channel and
how large the mouth of the pore is.  The <small>HOLE</small> package does not explicitly 
produce graphs but instead provides easily accessible numerical information so
that the user can use the graph plotting program of his/her choice.<p>

Graphical presentation can be complimented by examination of <small>HOLE</small> objects
using a molecular graphics program.  Two objects can be produced and
displayed in conjunction with the ion channel structural model.
<ul>
	<li>The centre line of the channel can be shown by plotting
	the locus of the centre of the sphere as it proceeds through
	the channel.
<a name=visual2back></a>
	<li>The locus of the surface of the spheres define the
	pore lining surface.  It is often useful to colour code
	the surface. The standard scheme is to use red to
	indicate parts of the pore where there is insufficient
	room to accommodate a water molecule, green where a single
	water molecule could be placed and blue for places
	sufficiently large for two water molecules to be placed side
	by side:

</ul>

<p>
The <small>HOLE</small> package is designed to be used primarily
with the quanta molecular graphics program.  However, conversion
routines are supplied to allow use with: 
<ul>
	<li>Sybyl
	<li>InsightII
	<li>O - Alwyn Jones crystallographic package.  For
	further details see the 
	<a href="http://kaktus.kemi.aau.dk/">O home page</a>.
	<li>mage: 
	Kinemage is a protein display and viewing language 
	developed by David Richardson. Kinemages can be viewed by the mage program which is available in versions for
     	MS-windows, mac and various unix machines.  Mage is available
	by ftp from <a href="ftp://suna.biochem.duke.edu/pub/">
	suna.biochem.duke.edu</a>.  (If you have mage then
	you can use this <a href="smallex.kin">example</a>).
	<li>Work which is still in progress allows the use of Virtual Reality 
	Modeling Language (VRML) which may become standard way of
	 representing 3D objects on the world wide web.
	If you have a suitable
	viewer (see <a href="http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/VRML/">
	http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/VRML/</a> for details) then
	try looking at the standard gramicidin <a href="example.wrl">example
	in vrml format</a>.</ul>

<p>
A recent advance allows an alternative view of the internal surface
of a pore - from the inside.  In this case we set up a cylindrical
co-ordinate system working from the pore centreline:
<center><a href="cylind.gif"><img src="cylindi.gif" align=bottom>
	</a><small><i><br>(click to see picture full size)</i></small></center> 
<p>
<a name=k033gonback></a>
This coordinate system can then be used to display properties
of the pore lining in two dimensions.  A simple way of
imagining how the maps are constructed is to
imagine that the internal surface of the pore is
cut down a line and then rolled flat.  A number of properties
of the internal surface of the pore can then be displayed, for instance,
whether the surface is lined by oxygen or nitrogen atoms.  The versatile 
contour plotting program <a href="http://www.golden.com/golden/">surfer</a> is used to process data produced by
<small>HOLE</small>.
This provides
a very different way of looking at the gramicidin channel:

	</a><small><i><br>(click to see picture full size)</i></small></center> 
<p>
<a name=anisotropy></a>

<h4>Analyzing anisotropy</h4>
The use of a spherical probe to analyse the pore dimensions of a channel has 
proved to be extremely useful<sup><a href="refer.html#smart93">6</a>,
<a href="refer.html#smart96">11</a></sup>.  However, the pores of many larger ion channels are clearly anisotropic as 
exemplified by porins<sup>
<a href="refer.html#cowan">15</a>,<a href="refer.html#weiss">16</a></sup>.  
To be able to analyse and consistently measure such structural aspects an extension
of the original <small>HOLE</small> method is introduced. <p>

Instead of using a sphere to probe the internal surface of the channel in question
a spherocylinder (capsule) 
is considered.  This object can be considered to be a simple
extension of a sphere where the centre is spread from a point onto a line section.
It can be defined in terms of three properties: two centres and a radius (in comparison
to a sphere which has a single centre and a radius):

<center><a href="capsule.gif"><img src="capsulei.gif" align=bottom>
	</a><small><i><br>(click to see picture full size)</i></small></center> 
<p>
In the <small>HOLE</small> method the axis of the capsule is held at 
right angles to the channel direction vector <b>v</b>. 
Only small adaptations are required to implement this: instead of
a single centre being considered in the optimization, two independent
centres are introduced.  Each of these is constrained to move on
a plane normal to the channel direction vector <b>v</b>.  Instead
of optimizing the radius of the sphere as in the original routine
the area of the capsule on the plane normal to <b>v</b> is maximized
(although this is converted in the program into an effective
radius to ease comparisons).
As the number of independent  variables is doubled from two to four,
more steps of simulated annealing are required to achieve stability
in results.  Despite this increased cpu requirement 
most channels can be analyzed in well under one hour of cpu time on
a modern workstation.  The result of optimizing a capsule inside the pore
of gramicidin is shown below:

<a name=capsule2back</a>
<center><a href="capsule2.html"><img src="capsule2i.gif" align=bottom>
        </a><small><i><br>(click to see picture full size)</i></small></center

<p>
The use of the capsule option allows the measurement of the
anisotropy of a channel and properties such as the rotation of
the capsule vector as it proceeds through the channel.
Examples of this can be found in the <a href="sect3.html">Applications</a>
section.  The more accurate delimitation of the cross-sectional area of
the channel as a function of distance along the channel vector
is also useful when making predictions of the conductance
properties of channels as discussed below. 




<h4>Predicting conductance properties 
     using <small>HOLE</small></h4>

<p>
The difficulty in experimentally determining
the three-dimensional structures of ion channels often make it necessary to
resort to modelling techniques.  Although modelling can lead to insights
into the functional and structural properties of channels there is
always the problem of knowing what level of confidence to place
in the model.  For this reason, tractable methods of validating 
a given model of a channel are required.  HOLE has been adapted
so that a reasonable prediction of the conductance of a channel
can be rapidly made on the basis of its 
structure<sup><a href="refer.html#smart96">11</a></sup>.
<p>
The method is based on simple Ohmic considerations.   The <small>HOLE</small>
program can be thought of as measuring the cross section area 
<big><i>A(z)</i></big> of a pore as a function of distance along the 
channel direction vector <big><i>z</i></big>.  Consider the pore
to be filled with an electrolytic solution of resisitivity 
<big><i>&#222;</i></big>.  A reasonable approximation 
of the resistance of the channel is given by:</br>


<center><big><i>G<sup>-1</sup><sub><small>macro</small></sub> = 
<img src="sumz.gif" border=0 align=middle>&#222; s/A(z) </i></big></center>

where <big><i>s</i></big> is the width between parallel planes used in
<small>HOLE</small> (see <a href="#mc">above</a>).  Note that 
in ion channel patch
clamping studies it is normal to consider conductance (<big><i>G</i></big>)
measured in Siemens (S) rather than resistance.  This type of approach 
was pioneered by Hille<sup><a href="refer.html#hille">2</a></sup> and introduced
into the <small>HOLE</small> methodology by Sansom and Kerr
<sup><a href="refer.html#sansom95">17</a></sup>.
<p>

The above equation assumes that the conductivity of an ionic solution
within a channel is equal to that of bulk solution.  This would
be true if ion channels had macroscopic dimensions (much larger
than a water molecule).  In practice it is found that real channels
have a conductance which is around five times lower than that expected
from the above equation giving the macroscopic limit 
<big><i>G<sub><small>macro</small></sub></i></big>.
In order to make a reasonable estimate of the conductance of
a channel, an empirically-based correction factor is used,
which is chosen to be dependent on the minimum radius of
the channel:
</br>


<center><big><i>
G<sub><small>pred</small></sub> =
G<sub><small>macro</small></sub>/C(R<sub><small>min</small></sub>)</i></big></center>

<a name=predictgback</a>

<p>
The correction factor was parameterized<sup><a href="refer.html#smart96">11</a></sup> 
on the results obtained
for the gramicidin channel<sup><a href="refer.html#arseniev">14</a></sup> 
and the <i>E. coli</i> OmpF porin<sup><a href="refer.html#cowan">15</a></sup>.
The prediction routine was tested by "predicting" the conductance
found for all channel-forming proteins and peptides where an experimental
structure is available<sup><a href="refer.html#smart96">11</a></sup>.
Results are summarized in the following graph:
 
<center><a href="predictg.html"><img src="predictgi.gif" align=bottom><br>
	<small><i>(click to see picture full size)</i></small></a></center> 
<p>
Overall, the algorithm yield good results with predictions accurate
to within a average factor of 1.8 to the experimental values. This accuracy is sufficient
to make the method a useful part in validating model structures.
 Further 
work has been undertaken to reparameterize the correction function
on the basis of all well defined structures which were 
considered<sup><a href="refer.html#smart96">11</a></sup>.
Future work will involve include using molecular dynamics
simulation procedures to find quantities such as the variation
of the self-diffusion co-efficient of water molecules within the channel
and including such effects within the prediction methodology.  <p>

It is also possible to adapt the procedure to predict the effect of
adding non-electrolytes such as PEG to conductance measurements.
Such experiments can be interpreted in terms of a radius profile
for a channel.  Encouraging preliminary 
results<sup><a href="refer.html#smart96">11</a></sup> have been obtained
comparing the expected profile calculated by <small>HOLE</small>
from the X-ray structure of cholera toxin B 
subunit<sup><a href="refer.html#merritt">19</a></sup> with the
experimental result<sup><a href="refer.html#krasilnikov">21</a></sup>.
