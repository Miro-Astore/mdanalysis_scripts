<a name="maps"><h3>6.5 Creating 2D Maps of the internal surface of a pore</h3>

A recent advance allows an alternative view of the internal surface
of a pore - from the inside.  In this case we set up a cylindrical
co-ordinate system working from the pore centreline:
<center><img src="mgms_article/cylind.gif" align=bottom></center> 
<p>
This coordinate system can then be used to display properties
of the pore lining in two dimensions.  A simple way of
imagining how the maps are constructed is to
imagine that the internal surface of the pore is
cut down a line and then rolled flat.  A number of properties
of the internal surface of the pore can then be displayed, for instance,
whether the surface is lined by oxygen or nitrogen atoms.  
<a href="mgms_article/k033gon.html">An
example</a> of such a picture is given in the J. Mol. Graphics
article which forms part of this documentation.
<p>
<a name="phos"></a
Another useful map to produce is one showing which residues line the pore:
<p>
<center>
<img align=center src="1psl_surface.gif"></a>
<p><b> The change in the residues lining
internal surface of phospholamban model structure during a molecular dynamics run
(thanks to Mark Sansom for the coordinates).  It is immediately apparent that 
the model is a 5 helix bundle and the changes to which residues line the pore
are obvious.   This picture was produced using surfer.
</b>
</center>
<p>
Such a map can be left monochrome or coloured according to residue properties.
In this case a different colour is used for residues from different chains.
Other possibilities are to colour residues according to residue number or
charge.

<h3>How to produce 2D maps in practice</h3>

The routines included in HOLE to produce 2D maps were written to
produce files suitable for use with <b>surfer</b> drawing program.
This is a very flexible mapping program, primarily used by
cartographers, geographers and similar 
(who know better than most how to make a nice map).
It is only available in for pc's running DOS or windows
and costs $499.  If you want to produce pretty pictures and
have the cash you can find further information at
<a href="http://www.golden.com/">http://www.golden.com/</a>.
I haven't provided any specific information about how to use
the files produced by HOLE with surfer because (a) its pretty
obvious once you have worked through the surfer tutorial (b) I seriously doubt
whether you are going to shell out the money for the program anyway!  
E-mail me if you do - and I'll address this deficiency.
<p>
Because I know how hard up all you researchers
are I have gone to the trouble of digging around for a free
more machine independent solution.  The best program which
I found for the purpose was <b>gnuplot</b>

<p>
The first step is to do a hole run in which the 
<a href="hole_d03.html#2DMAPS">2DMAPS card</a> is specified in
the input file.  In the ~/hole2/example directory the file "2dmap.inp"
shows such an input file (directly adapted from "example.inp"):
<pre>
! example input file run on Arseniev's gramicidin structure
! Adapted from standard example.inp to produce 2D maps see section 6.5
! of hole documentation for details.
coord  1grm_single.pdb          
radius ~/hole2/rad/simple.rad
cvect  0 1 0                    
cpoint 0 0 3             
sample 0.25                     
endrad 5.

shorto 2            ! cut down on output
2dmaps 2d_example   ! filename root - many files will be produced with
                    ! this as a start
</pre>
Note that you cannot include the CAPSULE card when producing 2D maps -
the routine cannot handle anisotropy.<p>

The end of the output file (included as "2dmap.out") lists what has been
produced:

<pre>
2d_example_touch.grd for map of touching distance
2d_example_capost.dat for Calpha posting info
2d_example_caline.bln for Calpha connecting lines (blanking format)
2d_example_res.bln for contacting residue base map (blanking format)
2d_example_on_map.grd for map Oxygen/Nitrogen neighbour presence
  (value 1 for oxygen, -1 for nitrogen and zero for any other)
2d_example_resno_map.grd for map of residue number
2d_example_polar_map.grd for map of residue polarity
  (1 for glu,asp; -1 for lys/arg; +0.1 tyr,ser,his,gln)
2d_example_chain_map.grd for map of chain id
  (number is the offset ascii value for the character
   i.e. if chain id's go A, B, C numbers will go 1,2,3)
2d_example_for_make_post_map.hole for file to be used with make_post_map to make
 better post map
2d_example_resid.dat for residue patch identities
 HOLE: normal completion
</pre>

Note all the filenames begin with the root <tt>2d_example</tt> as specified
by the <tt>2dmaps</tt> card.  The files can be directly read into surfer.
Files of type .grd are grid files which contain information to produce a
contour map (or mesh surface).  Type .bln ("blanking null") contains
information to draw lines on a 2D surface.  Type .dat contain information
for posting points on a 2D surface and labelling them.<p>

Here is a more detailed description of what each file contains:

<blockquote>
<p>
<bl><li><i>Files containing map type information:</i></bl>

<dl>
	<dt>fileroot_touch.grd
	<dd>This contains information as to distance (in Angstroms)
	from the centre line to the closest atom surface at that point.
	Maps can display anisotropic features (such as side opening etc.).
<p>
	<dt>fileroot_on_map.grd
	<dd>This contains information as to whether the closest non-hydrogen
	atom to the HOLE surface at this coordinate is an oxygen (value +1),
	a nitrogen (-1) or something else.  Used in the  
	<a href="mgms_article/k033gon.html">gramicidin</a> map example
<p>

	<dt>fileroot_resno_map.grd
	<dd>This contains information as the residue number of
	the closest non-hydrogen atom to the HOLE surface at this coordinate
	(value is the residue number).
<p>
	<dt>fileroot_chain_map.grd
	<dd>This contains information as the chain identity of
	the closest non-hydrogen atom to the HOLE surface at this coordinate.
	Each chain with have a seperate numberical value starting at 1
	 and then equal to the ichar(chain_id)-ichar(chain_id_1st_atom)+1
	 (ichar() is fortran function giving the ascii number for any character).
	This map is used in <a href="#phos">picture</a> of phospholamban above.
<p>
	<dt>fileroot_polar_map.grd
	<dd>This contains information as the polarity of the residue for
	the closest non-hydrogen atom to the HOLE surface at this coordinate.
	Value 1 for glu,asp; -1 for lys/arg; +0.1 tyr,ser,his,gln.
<p>
</dl>

<p>
<bl><li><i>Files containing line drawing information:</i></bl>

<dl>

	<b><dt>fileroot_res.bln</b>
	<dd>This is not a map file but contains information as to the
	boundaries between different residues.  Similar pictures
	can be gained by drawing maps with chain_id/residue number but
	the .bln file is neat and easy.  In the 
	<a href="#phos">phospholamban</a> and the 
	<a href="mgms_article/k033gon.html">gramicidin</a> pictures this
	is used to draw a black line between different residues in 
	a neat way.  This is one of the most useful files
	if you are limited to using gnuplot (see below).
	
<p>
	<b><dt>fileroot_caline.bln</b>
	<dd>This file contains the information for drawing lines connecting
	the points of projection of Calpha atoms onto the surface.  Very
	useful - shows the relation of the structure to the surface -
	see <a href="#phos">pictures</a> of phospholamban above. 
 
<p>
</dl>

<p>
<bl><li><i>Files containing information for placing labels:</i></bl>
<dl>
	
	<dt>fileroot_resid.dat
	<dd>This file contains the information for placing labels stating
	what residue each patch refers to.  The label is placed at the centroid
	of the total positions for that residue.  For complex maps in which
	a single residue has two or more patches this can mean that the label
	lies outside any of the patches involved.  For this reason a way of
	producing better labels was written:
	
<a name="make_post_map"></a>
<p>
<b><dt>fileroot_for_make_post_map.hole</b>
	<dd>This file can be used with the seperate program make_post_map
	(supplied with hole and automatically setup with the package)
	to produce much better residue id labels than the ones above.
	To use simply get to the directory containing the file
	and type "make_post_map" (and the enter key) like in this example:
	
	<pre>
jura> <b>cd ~/hole2/example</b>
jura> <b>ls *.hole</b>
2d_example_for_make_post_map.hole
jura> <b>make_post_map</b>

	at the point furthest from any other patch.  The label list starts
	this the largest patch and goes to the smallest.  If the map is
	rather cluttered simply delete the labels at the end of the file.
	
	<p>
	<dt>fileroot_capost.dat
	<dd>This file contains labels for the positions of Calpha atoms
	projected onto the surface - useful in conjunction with

<h3>Using gnuplot to draw maps</h3>

As explained above the 2D map support in HOLE was written for use with the 
program surfer but because of the cost of the package and its restriction to
pc's the use of gnuplot is now supported.  It is not as easy to produce
really pretty maps with gnuplot but with a bit of effort reasonable results
can be obtained. <p>

Gnuplot is a public domain quite reasonable 2D/3D graph plotter.  It is
command line driven and is supported on wide range of machines.  The
examples given here were run with gnuplot unix version 3.5 (pre 3.6)
patchlevel beta 332 (run on a sg under IRIX5.2).  
For more details of gnuplot see the 
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/gnuplot_info.html">gnuplot homepage</a>,
a convenient European place to download the latest version of gnuplot is
from this <a href="ftp://cmpc1.phys.soton.ac.uk/pub/">ftp site</a> at the
Department of  Physics & Astronomy at the University of Southampton, UK.<p>

In order to use the surfer type files with gnuplot then they must be
converted into a form suitable for gnu.  Conversion programs are
supplied with HOLE and should have been setup automatically with hole.
The following table describes how to convert each file produced by
HOLE or make_post_map.

     </td>
  
     </tr>
     

     <tr>
     <td valign=top>Labels for residue patches<br>
     <i>fileroot_for_make_post_map.dat</i> <br>
     (output of program <a href="#make_post_map">make_post_map</a>).
  
     </td>
     <td align=center>make_post2gnu < fileroot_for_make_post_map.dat > 
     fileroot_for_make_post_map.gnu
     </td>

     </td>
     <td align=center>load "fileroot_for_make_post_map.gnu" 
     </td>
  
     </tr>
     
     <tr>
     <td valign=top>Labels for Calpha positions<br>
     <i>fileroot_capost.dat</i> 
  
     </td>
     <td align=center>capost2gnu < fileroot_capost.dat > 
     fileroot_capost.gnu
     </td>

     </td>
     <td align=center>load "fileroot_capost.gnu"
     </td>
  
     </tr>
    
</table>
</center>
<p>

Note because gnuplot contour plotting allows only very limited features
it may be best to concentrate on using the .bln and .dat type files
in 2D mode (plot rather than splot). 

<h3>Example application</h3>


Example run in ~/hole2/example using files created in HOLE run and
make_post_map application described above in this document.
<p>

The first thing to do is convert the files above into a suitable
form:
<pre>
jura> <b>bln2gnu < 2d_example_caline.bln > 2d_example_caline.gnu</b>
jura> <b>bln2gnu < 2d_example_res.bln > 2d_example_res.gnu      </b>
jura> <b>make_post2gnu < 2d_example_for_make_post_map.dat > 2d_example_for_make_post_map.gnu</b>
jura>
</pre>
<p>
Then simply run gnuplot <i>(!indicates a comment do not enter yourself!!)</i>
<pre>
jura> <b>gnuplot</b>
